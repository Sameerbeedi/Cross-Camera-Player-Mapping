# Player Detection and Cross-Camera Tracking Project Report

## Approach and Methodology

1. **Multi-Stage Pipeline**
   - YOLO-based player detection
   - Visual feature extraction
   - Cross-camera player matching
   - Result visualization

2. **Technology Stack**
   - Python with OpenCV for video processing
   - YOLOv11 for object detection
   - PyTorch for deep learning features

## Techniques and Outcomes

1. **Player Detection**
   - Used fine-tuned YOLOv11 model
   - Successfully detects players in both broadcast and tactical views
   - Output stored as JSON with bounding box coordinates

2. **Feature Extraction**
   - Extracted visual features from player patches
   - Used position and appearance information

3. **Cross-Camera Matching**
   - Implemented player ID mapping between views
   - Maintained consistent IDs across camera switches

## Challenges Encountered

1. **Technical Challenges**
   - Occlusion handling in crowded scenes
   - Real-time processing requirements
   - Varying camera angles and perspectives

2. **Implementation Issues**
   - Model deployment size constraints
   - Video processing memory usage
   - Synchronization between camera feeds

## Future Work

1. **Improvements Needed**
   - Real-time processing optimization
   - Better handling of player occlusions
   - Enhanced feature matching algorithms

2. **Next Steps**
   - Implement player trajectory prediction
   - Add team identification
   - Develop web interface for visualization

## Resource Requirements

1. **Computing Resources**
   - GPU for faster model inference
